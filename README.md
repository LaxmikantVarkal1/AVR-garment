# AVR GARMENT Management System

A comprehensive dashboard for managing garment production workflows, designed to streamline operations from cloth reception to final garment collection.

## Project Overview

**AVR Garment Management System** helps track the complete lifecycle of garment production. The system provides role-based dashboards to ensure transparency, accountability, and smooth coordination between different stages of production.

Authentication and data storage are securely managed using **Supabase**, enabling role-based login, real-time data updates, and reliable database handling.

## Data Structure (Garment Data)

The core tracking entity in this system is the **Party**, which represents a client or source. Each Party contains multiple **Items**.

### Party
- `id`: Unique identifier for the party  
- `party_name`: Name of the client (e.g., "ABC Textiles")  
- `items`: Array of garment orders associated with the party

### Item

Each item represents a specific garment order.

#### Identity
- `id`: Unique Item ID (e.g., "10001")  
- `name`: Garment type (e.g., "panjabi", "shirt")  
- `description`: Additional details about the item  

#### Production Metrics
- `recived`: Quantity of cloth received (e.g., "8000m")  
- `cuttting`: Quantity of cloth cut (e.g., "1000m")  
- `collected`: Quantity or status of finished garments  

#### Distribution & Tracking
- `sizes`: Array of size distributions  
  - Example: `["34:10", "36:12"]`  
- `user`: List of assigned workers/users  

#### Timeline
- `givenClothDate`: Date when the cloth was received  
- `cuttingDate`: Scheduled or actual cutting date  
- `collectDate`: Scheduled or actual collection date
